# Overview

## What is Clinical Decision Support?

Clinical Decision Support (CDS) is a service that enables healthcare providers to make well-informed decisions by supplying guidance, knowledge, and patient-specific information at relevant points in the patient journey, such as diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up. CDS uses a range of mechanisms to assist users in this process. Examples of these mechanisms include automated alerts or reminders, clinical guidelines, contextually relevant reference information, conditional order sets, diagnostic support, and patient-focused reports, forms, or templates. The beneficiaries of the information derived from CDS may include patients, clinicians, and others involved in the delivery of health care.

It is important to distinguish the general practice of clinical decision support from the application of tools designed to enhance decision support practices. One is performed by humans who make decisions based on knowledge they possess and information they consume. The other is computed by systems and engines using rules and predefined conditions. Although both are important, the technical components of CDS are designed to assist rather than replace the subtle judgment and guidance provided by the clinician.

Applications and tools that provide clinical decision support are known as as [Clinical Decision Support Systems](#user-content-fn-1)[^1] (CDSS). A clinical decision support system is defined as a computer system or software application designed to assist clinicians, caregivers, or patients in healthcare and/or treatment decisions.

Notes

* Typically a clinical decision support system responds to triggers, such as specific signs or symptoms, diagnoses, laboratory test results, medication selections, or complex combinations of such triggers. The system then provides information or recommendations relevant to the specific patient.

## History

It has been suggested that the origins of clinical decision support (CDS) can be traced back to the 1950s and 1960s.[ In an early example from 1961, Dr. Homer Warner, a cardiologist from the University of Utah developed a mathematical model which was used to diagnose heart disease](#user-content-fn-2)[^2]. Since then, there have been countless developments and advancements in the area of decision support. Many theories have been proposed as to how CDS should be approached and applied in clinical practice.

## The Five Rights

When implemented properly, CDS has the potential to enhance patient care, reduce errors and duplication of effort, and introduce efficiencies to the clinical workflow. Conversely, CDS tools can also be distracting and disruptive, even producing unwanted consequences. It is therefore important to consider the lessons learned from previous implementations of CDS and conduct thorough requirements analysis prior to designing or procuring a CDSS. One of the best practice frameworks that has been developed to guide those considering a CDS implementation is the[ "CDS Five Rights"](#user-content-fn-3)[^3]. "The Five Rights" suggests that to realize the full potential of CDS, solutions should:

* **Supply the&#x20;**_**right information**_**&#x20;(evidence-based guidance, address the clinical need)**
* **To the&#x20;**_**right people**_**&#x20;(entire care team, including the patient)**
* **Using the&#x20;**_**right channels**_**&#x20;(e.g., EHR, mobile devices, patient portals)**
* **In the&#x20;**_**right intervention formats**_**&#x20;(e.g., order sets, flow-sheets, dashboards, patient lists)**
* **At the&#x20;**_**right points in the workflow**_**&#x20;(for decision making or action)**

## Example

A typical application of CDS is shown in the diagram below:

<figure><img src="../images/123897420.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Example of simple application of CDS</p></figcaption></figure>

The clinical setting in which this hypothetical tool has been applied is the prescribing of a medication. In this example, the patient has previously had an [91936005 <mark style="color:blue;">|</mark> Allergy to penicillin<mark style="color:blue;">|</mark>](http://snomed.info/id/91936005) recorded. When prescribing a new drug, such as [27658006 <mark style="color:blue;">|</mark> Amoxicillin<mark style="color:blue;">|</mark>](http://snomed.info/id/27658006), an alert is displayed to remind the clinician of the previously diagnosed allergy. The application may also provide a mechanism to search for alternative medications. Note that the mechanics of this workflow uses a predefined rule which specifies a condition to be evaluated and an action to be taken if the condition evaluates to true.

## Functional Areas

This section addresses the functional scope of clinical decision support. CDS may be represented in a variety of formats or tools which depend on the clinical situation or environment. These tools are often referred to as CDS formats, types, or interventions and can be deployed to a wide variety of systems and platforms, such as mobile devices.

[Within these functional areas, CDS can be further subdivided into tools which are prompted by the tasks a clinician performs such as patient charting or diagnosis, and functions that are triggered by external events such as the expiration of a period of time](#user-content-fn-4)[^4].[1](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCCDS/1.2.+Functional+Areas#Footnote1) Some of the more common CDS functions are described briefly in the table below. Use of these functions may be appropriate in a variety of clinical domains or use cases, some of which are discussed in the [Clinical Areas](1.1-overview.md#clinical-areas) section.

## Clinical Areas

The focus of this section is the clinical application of CDS tools or how the [functional components](1.1-overview.md#functional-areas) described earlier can be used in practice. Stakeholders from various clinical domains interact with clinical systems, such as EHRs with CDSS and CPOE (computerized physician order entry).

## SNOMED CT Features

This section contains a brief summary of key SNOMED CT features and explains how they may be useful in CDSSs.

### Concepts

SNOMED CT concepts are used to represent clinical meanings. Every concept in SNOMED CT is uniquely identified by a distinct SNOMED CT Concept Identifier. For example, [195967001](http://snomed.info/id/195967001) is the concept identifier for the concept [195967001 | Asthma|](http://snomed.info/id/195967001) .

SNOMED CT concepts play an important role in CDS by enabling actions to be triggered based on the meaning of data recorded in the patient records.

### Descriptions

SNOMED CT descriptions provide the human-readable terms associated with SNOMED CT concepts. A concept may have one or more descriptions, which act as synonyms for the same clinical meaning. This is also how SNOMED CT supports different dialects and languages.

SNOMED CT descriptions allow common CDS rules to be consistently applied across patient records recorded using different synonyms, dialects and languages.

### Relationships

SNOMED CT relationships link concepts together to formally define the meaning of each concept. For example, one type of relationship is the [116680003 | is a|](http://snomed.info/id/116680003) relationship which relates a concept to a parent or supertype. These [116680003 | is a|](http://snomed.info/id/116680003) relationships define the subtype hierarchy of SNOMED CT concepts.

For example, the concepts [53084003 | Bacterial pneumonia|](http://snomed.info/id/53084003) and [75570004 | Viral pneumonia|](http://snomed.info/id/75570004) both have an [116680003 | is a|](http://snomed.info/id/116680003) relationship to [233604007 <mark style="color:blue;">|</mark>Pneumonia<mark style="color:blue;">|</mark>](https://browser.ihtsdotools.org/?perspective=full\&conceptId1=233604007\&edition=MAIN\&release=\&languages=en) which has an [116680003 | is a|](http://snomed.info/id/116680003) relationship to the more general concept [128601007 <mark style="color:blue;">|</mark>Infectious disease of lung<mark style="color:blue;">|</mark>](https://browser.ihtsdotools.org/?perspective=full\&conceptId1=128601007\&edition=MAIN\&release=\&languages=en). Subtype relationships can be used by CDS rules to refer to codes in an EHR that are any specific type of a relevant clinical concept.

Additional attribute relationships help to define the meaning of a concept. For example, the concept [75570004 | Viral pneumonia|](http://snomed.info/id/75570004) has a [246075003 | Causative agent|](http://snomed.info/id/246075003) relationship to the concept [49872002 | Virus|](http://snomed.info/id/49872002) and a [363698007 | Finding site|](http://snomed.info/id/363698007) relationship to the concept [113255004 <mark style="color:blue;">|</mark>Structure of parenchyma of lung<mark style="color:blue;">|</mark>](https://browser.ihtsdotools.org/?perspective=full\&conceptId1=113255004\&edition=MAIN\&release=\&languages=en).

Attribute relationships can be used by CDS rules to refer to codes recorded in an EHR that have a specific meaningful relationship with a concept of interest.

### Concept Model

The SNOMED CT concept model is a set of rules that govern the ways in which SNOMED CT concepts are permitted to be modeled using relationships to other concepts. It defines the types of relationships that may be used on each type of concepts, and the permitted values for each relationship type. The [Machine Readable Concept Model (MRCM)](https://app.gitbook.com/o/h8Z6qGxuQrzM9vbx5bPT/s/wLJPOzgAQsSAYr6nhvCl/) represents the rules in the SNOMED CT concept model in a form that can be read by a computer and applied to test that concept definitions and expressions comply with these rules.

The SNOMED CT concept model plays an important role in CDS by providing the rules by which the clinical meaning of SNOMED CT encoded health records can be queried. The MRCM makes it possible to process these rules in a machine-processable way.

### Expressions

SNOMED CT provides a mechanism which enables clinical phrases to be represented by a computable expression, when a single concept does not capture the necessary level of detail. For example, the following expression represents a right hip:

```json

182201002 |Hip joint|:
272741003 |Laterality| = 4028007 |Right|

```

SNOMED CT expressions enable additional clinical meanings to be captured in a health record, without requiring the terminology to include countless combinations and permutations of precoordinated concepts.

SNOMED CT expressions facilitate CDS over an expanded set of clinical meanings that extends beyond individual concepts. For more information about expressions, please refer to the [SNOMED CT Compositional Grammar - Specification and Guide](https://app.gitbook.com/o/h8Z6qGxuQrzM9vbx5bPT/s/VgpC90r7t9DyATri97GG/).

### Reference Sets

SNOMED CT reference sets are a flexible and standardized approach used to support a variety of requirements for the customization and enhancement of SNOMED CT. These include the representation of subsets, language preferences for use of particular terms, mapping from or to other code systems, and ordered lists.

Reference sets may be used in the following aspects of CDS:

* Representing subsets of SNOMED CT concepts that may trigger a CDS action
* Representing non-standard aggregations of concepts for specific CDS use cases
* Defining language or dialect specific sets of descriptions over which term searches can be performed

For more information about reference sets, please refer to the [SNOMED CT Reference Set Guide](https://app.gitbook.com/o/h8Z6qGxuQrzM9vbx5bPT/s/qOI2v58ZsXOoklmwBOk4/).

### Description Logic Features

Description Logic (DL) is a family of formal knowledge representation languages and used as the formal foundation of meaning in SNOMED CT. The way that concepts have been modeled in SNOMED CT permits them to be represented using Description Logic. DL helps computers to make useful inferences about concepts, and to classify SNOMED CT using a DL reasoner. Description Logic also helps by testing expressions for subsumption and equivalence.

The logical inferences supported by DL can be useful when executing CDS rules. For example, when a CDS rule requires an action to be performed when the patient has any type of [195967001 | Asthma|](http://snomed.info/id/195967001) , a DL reasoner may be used to determine that [281239006 <mark style="color:blue;">|</mark>Acute asthma<mark style="color:blue;">|</mark>](https://browser.ihtsdotools.org/?perspective=full\&conceptId1=281239006\&edition=MAIN\&release=\&languages=en) and [427603009 | Intermittent asthma|](http://snomed.info/id/427603009) are both types of [195967001 | Asthma|](http://snomed.info/id/195967001) and should therefore both trigger the action to be performed.
