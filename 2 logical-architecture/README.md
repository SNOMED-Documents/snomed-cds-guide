# 2. Logical Architecture

This section provides an overview of the logical architecture of an electronic health record (EHR) which uses CDS.

In particular, it focuses on the logical architecture of knowledge-based CDSSs,[1](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCCDS/2.+Logical+Architecture#Footnote1 "Footnote: Click here to display the footnote") which use pre-loaded CDS artifacts (such as rules and guidelines) that closely match a human's natural reasoning process. Non-knowledge-based CDSSs, which use artificial intelligence (AI) or machine learning to acquire knowledge over time, are outside the scope of this guide.

The logical architecture of knowledge-based CDSSs are explored in the following subsections:

  * [2.1. EHR System Architecture](2.1.-EHR-System-Architecture_123897453.html)
  * [2.2. CDS System Architecture](2.2.-CDS-System-Architecture_123897466.html)
