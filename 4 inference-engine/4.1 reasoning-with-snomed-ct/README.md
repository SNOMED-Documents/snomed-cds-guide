# 4.1. Reasoning with SNOMED CT

[Features](1.4.-SNOMED-CT-Features_123897451.html) of SNOMED CT can be used in a range of techniques which may then be applied to clinical decision support. For example, these techniques can help to execute decision support logic by assisting the inference engine in evaluating the trigger conditions defined in CDS rules. 

This section describes these SNOMED CT techniques with respect to CDS by first providing an overview of the technique, and then presenting an example of how the inference engine can apply the technique to execute a specific CDS rule.

The following SNOMED CT techniques can be used by the CDS inference engine:
