# Appendix A - Decision Support Case Studies

As discussed in this guide, SNOMED CT is increasingly being used in clinical decision support (CDS) systems to support healthcare providers in making well informed clinical decisions.

This appendix presents two sets of case studies, which demonstrate the use (or planned use) of SNOMED CT in clinical decision support systems.

* [Organizational Case Studies](../Organizational-Case-Studies_123897677.html) describes a range of organizations that use SNOMED CT for clinical decision support;
* [Vendor Case Studies](../Vendor-Case-Studies_123897701.html) describes a number of commercial products that use SNOMED CT to enable clinical decision support.
